# Overview

The Syncfusion Flutter Calendar library was written natively in Dart and has seven types of built-in configurable view modes that provide basic functionality for scheduling, managing, and representing appointments efficiently. The Calendar Widget exposes a clean and convenient user interface for custom working days and hours and basic calendar operations such as date navigation and selection.

## Key features

* **Multiple calendar views**: A wide range of built-in view modes are available: day, week, workweek, month, timeline day, timeline week, timeline workweek. The control allows you to conveniently customize every view with unique, view-specific options.

* **Appointments**: Appointments contain information on events scheduled at specific times. In addition to default appointments, users can use their own collections to connect a business entity to an appointment by mapping their fields, such as start time, end time, subject, notes, and recurrence.
